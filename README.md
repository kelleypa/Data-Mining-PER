# Data-Mining-PER
Data mining textual and codified student information taken from three semesters of introductory physics course utilizing CourseNetworking (CN), a course-designed social media platform. The study was part of physics education research (PER). 

# Course Networking
CourseNetworking (CN) is a global academic networking site. The founder of CN is Dr Ali Jafari, professor of Computer and Information Technology at IUPUI as well as the director of Cyberlabs located at IUPUI, a research and development site for CN which also holds offices in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Guangzhou, China. The function of CN is to provide a course “networking” platform rather than course “management” system. CN enables students to communicate more efficaciously than traditional learning management systems (LMS). The LMS at IUPUI is Canvas, which has the advantage of having a central hub where course material is retrievable and administered. The only means of communication typically on the LMS is an online discussion or announcement board. CN provides a more natural environment for networking and communication, with many similarities to features implemented by Facebook. An interesting feature of CN is anar seeds which are a form of “micro-rewards”. These are gained through use of CN via logging in, posting, reflecting and even polling in addition to clicking a “like” button for each post or reflection similar to Facebook. Another similarity with Facebook is a “wall” format with postings by all the members made visible at the home page of the class or group. The control of the instructor is in the setting up of the class or group page with the point weight decided in advance for each action (login, posting, reflecting, polling and liking). A limit can also be imposed on the number of anar seeds students can gain each day. This hinders students from accumulating all required points for extra credit at the end of the semester. The introductory physics courses awarded 5% extra credit if more than 350 anar seeds were earned.

# Research Questions
1) Are there gender differences in the observed sentiment?
2) Are there differences in sentiment or performance between students who participate heavily on CN and those who do not? In other words, is there any sentiment overshadowing?
3) Do students that post more at night express different sentiment or perform differently academically than students that post only during the day?

# Data
Around 3000 posts and reflections were recorded in a semester in the 19 weeks of each course.

# Results
1) Gender Study
* CN can be a gender independent platform
2) Activity Study
* CN not dominated by most active users
3) Time of Day Study
* No link found between time of CN usage and student sentiment/performance
* CN can be used night or day
